# Project Idea Submission - Joseph Solway

### What is the topic you'd like to explore?

- Look at the change in building energy use data in NYC and see how changes in external temperature affect it

### Why is this topic personally important to you? What is it about the topic that most fascinates you?

- Energy consumption in buildings is a key component to climate change. Understanding the factors that affect that energy consumption are a key component to then looking at ways to reduce it

### What is the question, or what are the main questions, that you'd like to answer about this topic?

- Is there a direct correlation between energy consumption and the weather (temperature and humidity)?

- Using weather predictions can we predict future building energy consumption?

### What are the types of available data relevant to your questions?

- Building energy use [data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Energy-Usage-From-DOE-Buildings/mq6n-s45c/) from DoE buildings and meterological [data](https://weather-warehouse.com/WeatherHistory/PastWeatherData_NewYorkCentralPrkObsBelv_NewYork_NY_September.html) for NYC

### Beyond the community of this classroom, whom are the other audiences that you might like to reach with the results of this project?

- NYC agencies interested in planning for their future energy consumption
